        <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that originated in Rome, Italy. The exact origins of Carbonara are somewhat uncertain, and there are several theories about how the dish came to be.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients for a 4 people dish:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350 grams of spaghetti</li>
            <li>150 grams of pancetta or guanciale</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>75 grams of Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated</li>
            <li>75g Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (optional, depending on saltiness of the pancetta/guanciale)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>How to prepare:</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti according to the instructions on the package until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale (and minced garlic if using) and cook until it's golden and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, Pecorino Romano, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese until well combined. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Remember, the cheese and pancetta/guanciale are salty, so go easy on additional salt.</li>
            <li>Once the spaghetti is cooked, add it directly into the skillet with the cooked pancetta or guanciale. Toss well to combine, ensuring the pasta is coated with the rendered fat from the pancetta or guanciale.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat (very important, as you don't want the eggs to scramble) and immediately pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta. Working quickly, toss the pasta continuously so that the eggs thicken into a creamy sauce. If it seems too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen it up.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has thickened and coated the pasta evenly, serve immediately. Garnish with additional grated cheese and freshly ground black pepper if desired.</li>
        </ol>
