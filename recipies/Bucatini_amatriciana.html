            <li>300 grams of canned tomato, crushed</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Grated Pecorino Romano, for serving</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>How to prepare:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large pot of salted water over high heat and bring it to a boil. Cook the bucatini according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced guanciale or pancetta and cook until it's crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the cooked guanciale or pancetta from the skillet and set it aside on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add a bit more olive oil if needed. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until the onion is soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and red pepper flakes to the skillet. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Allow the sauce to simmer over medium-low heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked guanciale or pancetta back into the skillet and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Drain the cooked spaghetti and add it to the skillet with the sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve the spaghetti all'amatriciana hot, topped with a generous sprinkle of grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Buon appetito!</li>
